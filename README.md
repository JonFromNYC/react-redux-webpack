# react-redux-webpack
Rolodex using React, Redux, &amp; Webpack
This is also a Progressive Web App (PWA).

### Why I made this app
I wanted to see if I could recreate the application with less code, make it faster, and have it work as a PWA. I also wanted to see what I could do with the browsers cache api. The future goal of this application is to make a template for CI/CD.
